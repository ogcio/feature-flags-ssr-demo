  - User activities
- Audit trail features:
  - Change history
  - User attribution
  - Timestamp logging
  - Action details

## Day 2 Operations

### Maintenance Considerations
- Required Team Structure:
  - MongoDB DBA
  - Redis administrator
  - Platform/DevOps engineer
  - Feature flag administrators

### Operational Tasks
- Monitoring capabilities:
  - Basic metrics dashboard
  - Prometheus endpoints
  - Health check API
- Regular maintenance:
  - MongoDB backups
  - Redis maintenance
  - Log rotation
  - Performance tuning

## Performance & Caching

### Caching Architecture ✅
